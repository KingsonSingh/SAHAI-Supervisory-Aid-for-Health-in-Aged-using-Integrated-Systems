Thus there is a need to provide help to elderly people as well as provide necessary information to their loved ones. The elderly people living alone needs an automatic integrated solution as a support which would provide homely assistance by taking care of them. The project is based on kinect device which does not invade their privacy while monitoring multiple elderly people's normal activities and detecting fall or catastrophic conditions by measuring their gait and analyzing change in posture when they change from sitting to walking or vice versa. Support vector machine is used to classify the gait and posture data obtained from the kinect device. Normalization technique is used to identify multiple users and activities. With the help of machine learning algorithm normal and abnormal activities are identified. The proposed system also informs concerned person in the case of any emergency. Monitoring the status of usage of electronic appliances is also considered
